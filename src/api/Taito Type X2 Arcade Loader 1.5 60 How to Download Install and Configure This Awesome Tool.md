The Taito Type X2 is a series of arcade system boards released by Taito Corporation in 2007. It is based on PC hardware and can run various arcade games developed by Taito and other companies. Some of the most popular games on the Taito Type X2 include Street Fighter IV, BlazBlue, King of Fighters XII, and Elevator Action Death Parade.
 
However, not all Taito Type X2 games are easy to find or play. Some of them are rare, region-locked, or require special hardware or software to run. That's where the Taito Type X2 Arcade Loader 1.5 60 comes in. This is a collection of Taito Type X2 games that can be played on any PC using a custom loader program that bypasses the original security checks and allows for various settings and options.
