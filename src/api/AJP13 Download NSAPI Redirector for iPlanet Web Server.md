AJP13 is a protocol that allows communication between a web server and a servlet container. AJP13 stands for Apache JServ Protocol version 1.3, which is supported by Apache Tomcat and other compliant servlet engines. AJP13 enables the web server to delegate requests for dynamic content to the servlet container, while serving static content directly.
 
One of the benefits of using AJP13 is that it can improve the performance and scalability of web applications, by reducing the overhead of HTTP processing and enabling load balancing and clustering. Another benefit is that it can simplify the configuration and management of web servers and servlet containers, by avoiding the need to expose multiple ports or use complex URL rewriting rules.

In this article, we will show you how to download and install an AJP13 connector for IIS and Tomcat, using the BonCode connector as an example. The BonCode connector is a free and open source solution that uses the .NET extensibility framework to connect IIS to Tomcat via AJP13. It is easy to script and deploy, works on all versions of IIS from 5.1 to 10, and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows systems.
 
## Step 1: Download the BonCode Connector
 
The first step is to download the BonCode connector from its official website: [http://www.boncode.net/boncode-connector](http://www.boncode.net/boncode-connector). You can choose between a zip file or an installer package. The zip file contains the connector files and documentation, while the installer package also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for setting up the connector.

For this tutorial, we will use the installer package, which is named Connector\_Setup.exe. You can save it to any location on your computer, such as your desktop or downloads folder.
 
## Step 2: Run the BonCode Connector Installer
 
The next step is to run the BonCode connector installer by double-clicking on the Connector\_Setup.exe file. You may see a security warning asking you if you want to run this file. Click on Run to proceed.
 
The installer will launch a GUI that will guide you through the installation process. You will see a welcome screen with some information about the BonCode connector. Click on Next to continue.
 
The installer will ask you to accept the license agreement for using the BonCode connector. Read the agreement carefully and select I Agree if you agree with the terms. Click on Next to continue.
 
The installer will ask you to choose a destination folder for installing the BonCode connector files. The default folder is C:\BonCodeAJP13. You can change it if you want, but make sure that you have write permissions on the chosen folder. Click on Next to continue.
 
The installer will ask you to choose an installation type: Typical or Custom. The Typical installation will install all the components of the BonCode connector with default settings. The Custom installation will allow you to select which components to install and configure some options. For this tutorial, we will use the Typical installation. Click on Next to continue.
 
The installer will ask you to confirm your installation choices. Review them carefully and click on Install to start the installation.
 
## Step 3: Configure the BonCode Connector
 
The installer will copy the BonCode connector files to your destination folder and configure them automatically. It will also create a handler mapping in IIS for processing requests via AJP13.
 
The installer will show you a summary of your installation results. You can see if there were any errors or warnings during the installation process. You can also view or edit some configuration files, such as workers.properties and uriworkermap.properties, which define how the BonCode connector communicates with Tomcat.
 
By default, the BonCode connector assumes that Tomcat is running on localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 8009, which is the default port for AJP13 in Tomcat. If your Tomcat instance is running on a different host or port, you need to edit workers.properties accordingly.
 
For example, if your Tomcat instance is running on another machine with
