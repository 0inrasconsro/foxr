- Tremolo: a periodic variation of volume.
- Auto-pan: a periodic variation of stereo balance.
- Trance-gate: a rhythmic gating effect that creates a pulsing sound.
- Side-chain compressor simulation: a dynamic effect that reduces the volume of one signal based on the level of another signal.
- Dubstep-type wobble: a modulation effect that creates a low-frequency oscillation of pitch or filter cutoff.

LFOTool has a flexible and intuitive interface that allows users to customize the shape, rate, phase, offset and depth of the modulation. Users can also sync the modulation to the tempo of the host or use an external MIDI clock. LFOTool also has a built-in filter section with various types and modes, as well as a distortion unit and a delay unit for further sound shaping.
