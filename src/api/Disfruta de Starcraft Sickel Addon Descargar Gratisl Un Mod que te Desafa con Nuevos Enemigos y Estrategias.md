In this article, we will review some of the new units and buildings that Starcraft Sickel Addon adds for each race. We will also discuss some of the strategies and tips that you can use to play with them. Let's start with the terran race.
 
## Terran Race
 
The terran race gets four new units and two new buildings in Starcraft Sickel Addon. The new units are the BFG tank, the hercules, the stealth dropship, and the ghost. The new buildings are the missile silo and the nuclear reactor.
 
### BFG Tank
 
The BFG tank is a powerful siege unit that can deal massive damage to ground and air targets. It has two modes: normal mode and siege mode. In normal mode, it can move and fire a single projectile that explodes on impact. In siege mode, it can't move but it can fire three projectiles at once that have a larger splash radius. The BFG tank is very effective against large groups of enemies or structures, but it is vulnerable to fast or cloaked units. You can use the BFG tank to defend your base or to support your army in an attack.
 
### Hercules
 
The hercules is a heavy transport unit that can carry up to 16 units inside. It has more health and armor than the regular dropship, and it can also fire missiles at air targets. The hercules is useful for transporting large armies across the map or for dropping them behind enemy lines. You can also use the hercules to evacuate your units from a dangerous situation or to save them from a nuclear strike.
 
### Stealth Dropship
 
The stealth dropship is a special transport unit that can cloak itself and its passengers. It has less health and armor than the regular dropship, and it can't fire at anything. The stealth dropship is ideal for sneaking into enemy bases or for performing surprise attacks. You can use the stealth dropship to drop units such as ghosts, firebats, or marines into the enemy's mineral line or production facilities. You can also use the stealth dropship to scout the enemy's movements or to harass them with nukes.
 
### Ghost
 
The ghost is a covert ops unit that can cloak itself and use various abilities. It has more health and energy than the regular ghost, and it can also fire a sniper rifle that deals more damage than the regular rifle. The ghost has three abilities: lockdown, nuke strike, and EMP shockwave. Lockdown disables a mechanical or robotic unit for a period of time. Nuke strike calls down a nuclear missile from a nearby missile silo that deals massive damage to everything in its blast radius. EMP shockwave drains the energy and shields of all units and buildings in a small area. The ghost is a versatile unit that can perform various roles such as scouting, sniping, sabotaging, or nuking.
 
### Missile Silo
 
The missile silo is a building that produces and stores nuclear missiles. It requires a nuclear reactor to function. Each missile silo can hold up to two nuclear missiles at a time. You can use the missile silo to launch nuclear strikes at any location on the map that you have vision of. You can also use the missile silo to deter enemy attacks or to force them to move their units or buildings.
 
### Nuclear Reactor
 
The nuclear reactor is a building that provides energy for your missile silos. It also increases your supply limit by 10. You need one nuclear reactor for each missile silo you have. You can use the nuclear reactor to power up your nukes or to expand your army size.
