In this article, we will briefly discuss the first chapter of the book, which is about the definition and status of a believer. The author begins by explaining the meaning of the word "momin" in Arabic, which is derived from the root word "aman", meaning to be secure, safe, and peaceful. A momin is someone who has attained security and peace in his heart by believing in Allah and His messengers, and by submitting to His commands and prohibitions. A momin is also someone who provides security and peace to others by being truthful, trustworthy, and benevolent.
 
The author then cites various verses from the Quran and Hadith that describe the qualities and attributes of a momin. Some of these are:

- A momin is someone who believes in Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and the divine decree.
- A momin is someone who worships Allah alone, without associating any partners with Him.
- A momin is someone who performs the obligatory prayers, pays the zakat (obligatory charity), fasts in Ramadan, and performs the Hajj (pilgrimage) if he is able to do so.
- A momin is someone who loves Allah and His messenger more than anything else in the world.
- A momin is someone who obeys Allah and His messenger in all matters, whether they are easy or difficult.
- A momin is someone who avoids what Allah and His messenger have forbidden, such as shirk (polytheism), kufr (disbelief), nifaq (hypocrisy), bid'ah (innovation), sin, and transgression.
- A momin is someone who enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil.
- A momin is someone who is patient in adversity and grateful in prosperity.
- A momin is someone who is humble, modest, sincere, honest, just, kind, generous, merciful, forgiving, and compassionate.
- A momin is someone who has a good relationship with Allah and His creation.

The author then highlights the high status and rank of a momin in the sight of Allah and His messenger. He mentions that a momin is the best of people, the most beloved to Allah, the most honored in this world and the next, the most successful in achieving happiness and salvation, and the most deserving of paradise. He also mentions that a momin has a special bond with other believers, as they are brothers and sisters in faith. He quotes the famous Hadith that says: "The believers are like one body; if one part suffers, the whole body feels pain."
 
The author concludes the chapter by urging the readers to strive to become true believers by following the Quran and Sunnah. He warns them against falling into shirk, kufr, nifaq, bid'ah, sin, or deviation. He reminds them that faith is not only a matter of words or feelings, but also a matter of actions and deeds. He advises them to seek knowledge from authentic sources, to purify their hearts from diseases and doubts, to repent from their mistakes and shortcomings, to increase their good deeds and worship, to seek Allah's help and guidance, and to supplicate to Him sincerely. He also encourages them to support each other in faith and righteousness, to love each other for Allah's sake, to cooperate in good and piety, to advise each other sincerely, to forgive each other's faults, and to avoid envy, hatred, malice, or division.
